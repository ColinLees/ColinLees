# Hi, I'm Colin ðŸ‘‹ 

ðŸ˜„ I'm a software developer who is passionate about making open-source more accessible, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include C#, .NET Core, JavaScript and Blazor.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on adapting the [GOV.UK frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend) and applying it to new applications with Stockport Council. Along with this I am moving legacy and more recent applications over to .NET Core 3.1 and prepping the move to .NET 5 âœ¨

ðŸ“« How to reach me: Carrier pigeon?

âš¡ Fun fact: I have a collection of 50+ bad, BAD shark movies and I am only going to collect more!
